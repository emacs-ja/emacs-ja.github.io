<span id="Deadlines-and-Scheduling-1"></span><h3 class="section">8.3 Deadlines and Scheduling</h3>

<p>A timestamp may be preceded by special keywords to facilitate
planning:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><span><kbd>C-c C-d</kbd></span></dt>
<dd><p>Insert &lsquo;<samp>DEADLINE</samp>&rsquo; keyword along with a time stamp, in the line
following the headline.
</p>
<p>Meaning: the task&mdash;most likely a TODO item, though not
necessarily&mdash;is supposed to be finished on that date.
</p>
<p>On the deadline date, the task is listed in the agenda.  In
addition, the agenda for <em>today</em> carries a warning about the
approaching or missed deadline, starting <code>org-deadline-warning-days</code>
before the due date, and continuing until the entry is marked as
done.  An example:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">*** TODO write article about the Earth for the Guide
    DEADLINE: &lt;2004-02-29 Sun&gt;
    The editor in charge is [[bbdb:Ford Prefect]]
</pre></div>

</dd>
<dt><span><kbd>C-c C-s</kbd></span></dt>
<dd><p>Insert &lsquo;<samp>SCHEDULED</samp>&rsquo; keyword along with a stamp, in the line following
the headline.
</p>
<p>Meaning: you are planning to start working on that task on the given
date<a id="DOCF7" href="#FOOT7"><sup>7</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>The headline is listed under the given date<a id="DOCF8" href="#FOOT8"><sup>8</sup></a>.  In addition,
a reminder that the scheduled date has passed is present in the
compilation for <em>today</em>, until the entry is marked as done, i.e.,
the task is automatically forwarded until completed.
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">*** TODO Call Trillian for a date on New Years Eve.
    SCHEDULED: &lt;2004-12-25 Sat&gt;
</pre></div>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>Some tasks need to be repeated again and again.  Org mode helps to
organize such tasks using a so-called repeater in a &lsquo;<samp>DEADLINE</samp>&rsquo;,
&lsquo;<samp>SCHEDULED</samp>&rsquo;, or plain timestamps.  In the following example:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">** TODO Pay the rent
   DEADLINE: &lt;2005-10-01 Sat +1m&gt;
</pre></div>

<p>the &lsquo;<samp>+1m</samp>&rsquo; is a repeater; the intended interpretation is that the task
has a deadline on &lsquo;<samp>&lt;2005-10-01&gt;</samp>&rsquo; and repeats itself every (one) month
starting from that time.
</p>
</div>
<div class="footnote">
<hr>
<h4 class="footnotes-heading">Footnotes</h4>

<h5><a id="FOOT7" href="#DOCF7">(7)</a></h5>
<p>This is quite different from what is normally understood by
<em>scheduling a meeting</em>, which is done in Org by just inserting a time
stamp without keyword.</p>
<h5><a id="FOOT8" href="#DOCF8">(8)</a></h5>
<p>It will still be listed on that date after it has been marked
as done.  If you do not like this, set the variable
<code>org-agenda-skip-scheduled-if-done</code>.</p>
